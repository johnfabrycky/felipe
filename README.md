## 🌲 Development & Branching

The 'main' branch is PROTECTED. All new features or bug fixes must be developed on a dedicated branch and merged via Pull Request.

Current Branches:
* main (Production-ready)
* meals
* movies
* parking
* lates
* readme

**Contribution Workflow:**
1. Branching: For any improvements to current features, use a pre-existing branch (not main). Create a new branch if building a new cog (e.g., git checkout -b feature-name).
2. Pull Requests: Submit a PR to 'main' once work is verified.
3. Deployment: Merges occur during SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE to ensure stability.
